Description<br>
The SmartPetFeeder is an IoT-based project that revolutionizes pet feeding by leveraging advanced technologies. It offers pet owners a convenient and reliable solution to ensure their pets are fed even when they're away. This project showcases the integration of sensors, actuators, and network connectivity to create a connected ecosystem for automated feeding. With remote control capabilities, customizable feeding plans, portion control, and intelligent pet recognition, the SmartPetFeeder simplifies pet care while promoting the understanding of IoT systems.
Users can refill the box by controlling a mini servo motor and we used an LDR sensor to check the sufficiency of food in the bowl also, an ultrasonic sensor measured the amount of food in the box using distance and showed the deficiency with a red LED.<br>
