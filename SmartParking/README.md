Description
Ultrasonic Sensor:
    Utilized to detect the presence of vehicles at the exit.
    The sensor measures the distance of the vehicle from the exit to automate the opening of the door for cars to exit.

RFID-RC522 Sensor:
    Integrated to facilitate entry control.
    RFID tags enable seamless access for authorized vehicles by automatically opening the entry door.

Servo Motor:
    Linked to the RFID sensor for physically opening the door in response to authorized RFID signals.

Infrared (IR) Sensor:
    Employed to monitor parking spot occupancy.
    The sensor detects whether a spot is empty or occupied, aiding in efficient allocation of parking space.
